This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API in conjunction with a component that modifies the layout or state frequently.  The camera preview may freeze or become unresponsive, particularly on Android devices. This is often due to race conditions where layout updates interfere with the camera's rendering cycle.  The problem is exacerbated by complex UI updates or animations that occur while the camera is active.
