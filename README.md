# Expo Camera Preview Freezing Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo Camera preview freezes or becomes unresponsive when used with components that frequently update the layout or state.  The issue is particularly noticeable on Android devices.

## Bug Description
The camera preview intermittently freezes or stops updating when the surrounding UI undergoes frequent changes. This appears to be caused by race conditions between the camera's rendering process and UI updates.

## Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app using Expo Go or a similar Expo client.
4. Observe the camera preview.  You may see it freeze, especially when interacting with other UI elements on the screen.

## Solution
The solution involves optimizing UI updates to minimize interference with the camera's rendering. Techniques like `useMemo`, `React.memo`, and debouncing state updates can greatly improve the stability of the camera preview.
